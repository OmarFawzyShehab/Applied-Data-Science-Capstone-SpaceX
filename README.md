# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks showcasing the application of data science techniques to the SpaceX dataset.
The notebooks cover a range of topics, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. The goal is to predict rocket launch success based on various factors and to gain insights from the available data.

The project key tasks include:

Data preprocessing and visualization
Machine learning model development
Performance evaluation and model improvement
The SpaceX dataset provides valuable insights into the space exploration industry, and this repository serves as a hands-on demonstration of applying data science principles to a real-world problem.
